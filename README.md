# Harbor Breeze Hub

The goal of this project is to create a Node.js server meant to run on a Raspberry Pi with a 315MHz transmitter. It listens for commands sent to the server and relays them to the fan.

### Notice:
Using only this hub, you will not be able to control the fan using your phone or voice commands. As I develop this hub, I will begin working on a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin that will allow you to communicate with this hub and control your ceiling fan using Apple HomeKit.
